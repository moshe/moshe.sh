    My name is Moshe, I love to code everything, from deployment scripts to
    database admin dashboards and mobile applications.
    <br />In the last 4 and a half years, I worked at
    <a href="https://forter.com">forter</a> as a team member, team leader (Data
    science and backend) and internal tools developer.<br />I served in at the
    enterprise SRE team of an elite branch in the 8200 alumni.
