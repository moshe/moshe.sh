    My name is Moshe, I love to code, from deployment scripts to database admin
    dashboards and mobile applications.
    <br />In the last four and a half years, I worked at
    <a href="https://forter.com">Forter</a> as a team member, team leader (data
    science and backend), and internal tools developer.<br />I served in an
    enterprise SRE team of an elite branch in the 8200 alumni.
